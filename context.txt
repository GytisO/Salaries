Context
INSEE is the official french institute gathering data of many types around France. It can be demographic (Births, Deaths, Population Density...), Economic (Salary, Firms by activity / size...) and more.
It can be a great help to observe and measure inequality in the french population.

Acknowledgements
The entire dataset has been created (and actualized) by INSEE, I just uploaded it on Kaggle after doing some jobs and checks on it. I haven't seen INSEE on Kaggle yet but I think it would be great to bring the organization in as a Kaggle actor.

Inspiration
First aim I had creating that dataset was to provide a map of french towns with the number of firm that are settled in by size.
Now my goal is to explore inequality between men and women, youngsters and elders, working / social classes.
Population can also be a great filter to explain some phenomenons on the maps.
